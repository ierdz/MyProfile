   <h2><center><b><p style="font-family"courier new;"> Interest in I.T </p></b></center></h2>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;">
   <br> My interest in Information Technology is that it is a broad subject containing many topics that can be learnt to adapt different skills and experiences. Information Technology isn’t only about “computers” or “networking” it is also about learning and identifying problems internally or externally in order to maintain information systems error free. </br> 
<br> In years 9 to 11 in secondary school I chose to study I.T. In which I gained basic knowledge on information technology followed by developing websites as an assignment. </br>
<br> I have had a long interest in I.T however coming out of high school I chose to take a path to have a future career in the Business sector. 4 years have now past and I have decided to re-route into I.T hoping it will give me new knowledge and skills in the future. </br>
<br> Being a student in RMIT currently, I did not have to change Universities making it an easy process to enrol into this course. I chose to stay with RMIT as throughout my years of being an undergraduate I have had a positive experience with the overall environment, students, lecturers and tutors. Based at the Melbourne CBD campus, it was an easy route to get to from home, also with it being based in one of the main streets of Melbourne. </br>
<br>While studying I.T, I’d like to gain and acquire knowledge in how to program and develop websites which require coding at an intermediate level. Being able to identify syntax problems and correcting it in minimal time ensuring all codes run well. I would have hope to also learn the fundamentals of Information Technology and its topics, gaining a general insight for what could potentially be applied when in the IT sector of the workforce. </br>

<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;">Ideal Job </p></b></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Computer Technician</p></b></center>
   
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;">A Computer Technician’s role in a company is to ensure all computing hardware and programs have no issues and are running smoothly on a daily basis, followed by setting up computing equipment in new buildings and workplaces.</br>
<br>What makes this job appealing to me is that it is both a hands-on and theoretical job in the I.T department. I also enjoy building and setting up computers with also finding the solution to problems in a computer internally or externally for it to be repaired. </br>
<br>The typical skills of becoming a computer technician can be found and learned off internet sites such as; Youtube. Many tutorials for all skill segments and problem fixes can be watched and applied to gain skill and experience. There are qualifications for this job, however having a strong knowledge on information technology and computer systems is highly encouraged to make the job less stressful in times. </br>
<br>With skills learnt from previous classes of information technology, I have found an interest in wanting to learn more about computer technology and I.T. By building my own personal computer and encountering errors, I have learnt that building and setting up a PC can be difficult without having a general knowledge and watching tutorial’s. </br>
<br>I plan to obtain more skills towards this job as I am currently undertaking this course (Bachelor of Information Technology) to ensure I have gained more knowledge and experiences prior to working within the IT sector of the workforce. There is so much to know about IT which is great as there are many categories which fall into IT, computing and system hardware.</p></br></center>

<center><br><p style="font-family:courier new;">The results shown above are a general outcome of who I am currently. Based off the answers I have chosen from the specified questions, work best individually and if in a team I will work catering towards teammates to ensure the outcome is achieved without conflict. When in a team, I would not be delegating tasks, more so find ways to assist team members to accomplish their task.</br></center>
<center><br>With these results, it will influence my behaviour in a positive way. I will be able to focus a lot on my own work when in a team, not merely on pleasing other team members or causing conflict. Focussing on the finished product I will always ask team members if they need any assistance or anything else that needs to be done. </br></center>
<center><br>Although I am an introverted person, I will try my best to communicate and engage in all group activities. Participation is key in group projects and it is ideal for everyone to put in even efforts of work.</p> </br></center>

<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Project Idea </p></b></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;">Overview </p></b></center>
<center><center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> The project will be working towards developing an application for apple/android/windows users to get in touch and up to date with the latest trends. Whether it is fashion or entertainment, this app will have users be in the know of what’s happening interstate and globally. </p></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Motivation </p></b></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Seeing as more and more people rely on social media sites for news, the project will be aimed at users to not use social media sites to find out news and trends of either a particular game, shoe, clothing brand and artist. The aim of this application is to increase awareness and for users to gain interest on their preferred news genre, without having to use social media sites as they tend to get boring overtime</p></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Description </p></b></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> This app would be divided into categories, catering to all users. What’s featured in the app would be the latest news in games, music, clothing and random. These categories are maintained by the team which scout the internet or real-life to uncover information on any new news or leaks. An interesting feature in the app would be the ‘random’ news generator. When in the app, users have the option to select the random button to be entertained with whichever news from any category. </p></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Features </p></b></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Music </p></b></center>
<center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> As music is constantly growing daily, the genres we are mainly focussing on are: Rap/Hip-Hop, Pop, Techno, House and Alternative. 
These particular genres have had a strong influence in Generations Y and Z. With this being said, respectively they would have a sense of interest in receiving updates within these genres. 
 </p></center>
 <center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Gaming </p></b></center>
 <center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Gaming, as well as streaming have been increasingly becoming recognised towards consumers over the years. With ‘Battle Royale’ games such as; Fortnite, consumers would like to be in the know of new game releases and or news on professional gamers and eSports tournaments. </p></center>
 <center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Clothing </p></b></center>
   <center><p style="font-family:courier new;">High-fashion, streetwear and the shoe-game are on a whole new level now that Kanye West’s ‘Yeezy’ and Virgil Abloh’s ‘Off-White’ collection are taking control of consumers how the shoes are showcased. With limited availability on certain shoes, this app provides any leaks and raffle guides for all users to have the chance to purchase shoes on time. </p></center>
   <center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;">Tools and Technologies </p></b></center>
    <center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> MIT App inventor would be the main software for this project to be developed. It is easily accessible via the internet and has all the great features/p></center>
<center><b><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Skills Required </p></b></center>
   <center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Workers must know how to use the MIT App Inventor software in order to create and maintain application. </p></center>
   <center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> Outcome </p></b></center>
   <center><p style="font-family:courier new;"> If the project is successful, the team will look into ways to expand the app and its contents, the team will continue to form and implement ideas and surveys will be created for feedback. The feedback would then be taken into account for future planning and development.  </p></center>

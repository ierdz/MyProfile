<p style = "font-arial;font-size:16px;font-style:regular;">
   <br> My interest in Information Technology is that it is a broad subject containing many topics that can be learnt to adapt different skills and experiences. Information Technology isn’t only about “computers” or “networking” it is also about learning and identifying problems internally or externally in order to maintain information systems error free. </br> 
<br> In years 9 to 11 in secondary school I chose to study I.T. In which I gained basic knowledge on information technology followed by developing websites as an assignment. </br>
<br> I have had a long interest in I.T however coming out of high school I chose to take a path to have a future career in the Business sector. 4 years have now past and I have decided to re-route into I.T hoping it will give me new knowledge and skills in the future. </br>

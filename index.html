<b><p style = "font-arial;font-size:20px;font-style:regular;"> Interest in I.T </p></b>

<center><p style = "font-arial;font-size:16px;font-style:regular;">
   <br> My interest in Information Technology is that it is a broad subject containing many topics that can be learnt to adapt different skills and experiences. Information Technology isn’t only about “computers” or “networking” it is also about learning and identifying problems internally or externally in order to maintain information systems error free. </br> 
<br> In years 9 to 11 in secondary school I chose to study I.T. In which I gained basic knowledge on information technology followed by developing websites as an assignment. </br>
<br> I have had a long interest in I.T however coming out of high school I chose to take a path to have a future career in the Business sector. 4 years have now past and I have decided to re-route into I.T hoping it will give me new knowledge and skills in the future. </br>
<br> Being a student in RMIT currently, I did not have to change Universities making it an easy process to enrol into this course. I chose to stay with RMIT as throughout my years of being an undergraduate I have had a positive experience with the overall environment, students, lecturers and tutors. Based at the Melbourne CBD campus, it was an easy route to get to from home, also with it being based in one of the main streets of Melbourne. </br>
<br>While studying I.T, I’d like to gain and acquire knowledge in how to program and develop websites which require coding at an intermediate level. Being able to identify syntax problems and correcting it in minimal time ensuring all codes run well. I would have hope to also learn the fundamentals of Information Technology and its topics, gaining a general insight for what could potentially be applied when in the IT sector of the workforce. </br>

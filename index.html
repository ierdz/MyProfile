<center><b><p style = "font-arial;font-size:20px;font-style:regular;"> Interest in I.T </p></b></center> 
<center><p style = "font-arial;font-size:16px;font-style:regular;">
   <br> My interest in Information Technology is that it is a broad subject containing many topics that can be learnt to adapt different skills and experiences. Information Technology isn’t only about “computers” or “networking” it is also about learning and identifying problems internally or externally in order to maintain information systems error free. </br> 
<br> In years 9 to 11 in secondary school I chose to study I.T. In which I gained basic knowledge on information technology followed by developing websites as an assignment. </br>
<br> I have had a long interest in I.T however coming out of high school I chose to take a path to have a future career in the Business sector. 4 years have now past and I have decided to re-route into I.T hoping it will give me new knowledge and skills in the future. </br>
<br> Being a student in RMIT currently, I did not have to change Universities making it an easy process to enrol into this course. I chose to stay with RMIT as throughout my years of being an undergraduate I have had a positive experience with the overall environment, students, lecturers and tutors. Based at the Melbourne CBD campus, it was an easy route to get to from home, also with it being based in one of the main streets of Melbourne. </br>
<br>While studying I.T, I’d like to gain and acquire knowledge in how to program and develop websites which require coding at an intermediate level. Being able to identify syntax problems and correcting it in minimal time ensuring all codes run well. I would have hope to also learn the fundamentals of Information Technology and its topics, gaining a general insight for what could potentially be applied when in the IT sector of the workforce. </br>

<center><b><p style ="font-arial;font-size:20px;font-style:regular;"> Ideal Job </p></b></center>
<center><b><p style ="font-arial;font-size:25px;font-style:regular;"> Computer Technician</p></b></center> 
<center><br>A Computer Technician’s role in a company is to ensure all computing hardware and programs have no issues and are running smoothly on a daily basis, followed by setting up computing equipment in new buildings and workplaces.</br>
<br>What makes this job appealing to me is that it is both a hands-on and theoretical job in the I.T department. I also enjoy building and setting up computers with also finding the solution to problems in a computer internally or externally for it to be repaired. </br>
<br>The typical skills of becoming a computer technician can be found and learned off internet sites such as; Youtube. Many tutorials for all skill segments and problem fixes can be watched and applied to gain skill and experience. There are qualifications for this job, however having a strong knowledge on information technology and computer systems is highly encouraged to make the job less stressful in times. </br>
<br>With skills learnt from previous classes of information technology, I have found an interest in wanting to learn more about computer technology and I.T. By building my own personal computer and encountering errors, I have learnt that building and setting up a PC can be difficult without having a general knowledge and watching tutorial’s. </br>
<br>I plan to obtain more skills towards this job as I am currently undertaking this course (Bachelor of Information Technology) to ensure I have gained more knowledge and experiences prior to working within the IT sector of the workforce. There is so much to know about IT which is great as there are many categories which fall into IT, computing and system hardware. </br></center>

<center><br>The results shown above are a general outcome of who I am currently. Based off the answers I have chosen from the specified questions, work best individually and if in a team I will work catering towards teammates to ensure the outcome is achieved without conflict. When in a team, I would not be delegating tasks, more so find ways to assist team members to accomplish their task.</br></center>
<center><br>With these results, it will influence my behaviour in a positive way. I will be able to focus a lot on my own work when in a team, not merely on pleasing other team members or causing conflict. Focussing on the finished product I will always ask team members if they need any assistance or anything else that needs to be done. </br></center>
<center><br>Although I am an introverted person, I will try my best to communicate and engage in all group activities. Participation is key in group projects and it is ideal for everyone to put in even efforts of work. </br></center>
